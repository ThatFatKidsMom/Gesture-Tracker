# Gesture Tracker

This is a package to demonstrate how to use [contact trackers](https://github.com/VRLabs/Contact-Tracker) and additional proxmity recievers to determine if a player is doing any of the default gestures and drive parameters based on that.

## **Installation**
- Drag the "Gesture Tracker" prefab into the heirarchy  
- Right click on the prefab to unpack it and then drag it onto the base of your avatar  
- Select all objects that start with "Left" and drag in your right wrist bone into the empty source on the parent constraint  
- Select all objects that start with "Right" and drag in your left wrist bone into the empty source on the parent constraint  
- Merge the provided FX controller with yours using the [VRLabs Avatar 3.0 manager](https://github.com/VRLabs/Avatars-3.0-Manager)  
- Set WD settings according to your animator  
- Create a toggle in your menu to enable the system   

## **How to use**
Place your hands into the hands of another player and enable the system.
